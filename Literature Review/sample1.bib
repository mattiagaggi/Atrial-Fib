abstract="A model of atrial fibrillation as a cellular automaton on a triangulated sphere, a weighted undirected graph, is presented. We show the results of simulation for study of mechanisms of formation and stability of propagation of rotary excitation waves with heterogeneity of excitation propagation velocity and refractoriness of the myocardium. The simulation shows the possible existence of a stable rotor in a minimum area of pathological zone of 14 mm                                  2                                (diameter 4.3 mm) with the parameters of myocardium in pathological zone: velocity 0.1 m/s, refractoriness 100 ms; the main myocardium: velocity 1 m/s, refractoriness 200 ms.
